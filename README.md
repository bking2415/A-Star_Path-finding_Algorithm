# A-Star_Path-finding_Algorithm
Simple implementation of the A-Star Path-finding algorithm using pygame and tkinter as an user interface

## Assumptions
1. Perfect User. If mistakes are made in input code will crash
2. `mousePress` function. Do not click over the start and end node

## Instructions
1. Make sure all the proper libraries are imported (i.e. _pygame, tkinter, os_) and packages are installed.
2. Run `AStar_GUI.py` to start the user interface.
3. Input start and end node. Do not include spaces in coordinates (i.e. **0,0**)
4. Press on grid to create a **grey** maze for the algorithm to process
5. Press `space bar` to activate algorithm

## Project Structure 

- `AStar_GUI.py` -- Graphical user interface to run algorithm.
- `arrayBackedGrid.py` -- Example program to show using an array to back a grid on-screen using pygame.
- `maze.py` -- Simple creating a maze example for algorithm.
- `simple_AStar.py` -- A* Path-finding Algorithm fucntion and simple example.
